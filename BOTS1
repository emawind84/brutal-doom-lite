"Where the fuck are we now?"
"I don't like any of this."
"Well, time for slaughter!"
"For how long they are going to keep us on these arenas?"
"Oh no, not this shit again!"
"For how long have we been fighting on these shitholes?"
"If I must kill every single of you to get out of this place, I will!"
"Let's rock!"
"I'm comming to get you all!"
"You are already dead!"
"I am going to enjoy this."
"Seems like we are gonna have to kill each other again".
"I keep going 'round in circles ... no escape."
"You demons don't stand a chance against me."

[FragStrings]
"And stay the fuck down!"
"Stay dead this time!"
"Just don't get up. Stay on the floor goddamit!"
"Surprise! You are dead!"
"Tango down!"
"How are things down there?"
"Rest in pieces."
"You can't win!"
"Groovy!"
"Nothing like a good flesh wound. Stirs the soul doesn't it?"
"For just a moment, your sweet screams of agony made the voices stop."
"You were there, on Phobos. I saw you running away. I found you now."

[KilledStrings]
"You were just lucky!"
"You will fucking pay for that!"
"This fucking hurts goddamit!"
"Argh! You son of a bitch!"
"How the fuck am I alive again?"


[RoamingStrings]
"Come on, where are you?"
"Stay away from me your freaks!"
"You can't hide forever!"
"Come on, let's do it!"
"Hiding will only make things harder"


[LosingRoamingStrings]
"You are not going to stop me."
"I am not done with you yet!"
"Come here! We are not finished!"

[EnragedStrings]
"OH YOU FREAKING SON OF A BITCH!"
"YOU ARE SO DEAD!!"
"OK I AM DEFINITELY SHOOTING YOU DOWN NOW!"
"I WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER!"
"I WILL MAKE YOU PAY!"


[DemoralizedStrings]
"I wish this could just stop."
"I wish I could just stay dead."
"Why they keep reviving us just to die again?"
"I can't take this anymore!"

[WinStrings]
"I love the smell of dead bodies in the morning"
"Well, that went well!"
"GG!!"
"Job's done here. Gotta move on... too many demons..."
"All roads lead to hell. Every last one of 'em."

[LoseStrings]
"GG"
"I'm glad this is over"
"Fucking shit!"
"Shit!"
"Fuck!"
"Damn!"
"You were just lucky!"
"This isn't the end. I'll be back to finish what I started."
